# Ontology Prompt Templates

## **Ontology Domain Specification**
```plaintext

2. The details (name, age, occupation, skills, interests) are logically aligned with domain ontologies and structured knowledge representation.
3. If the skills and interests provided by the user are similar and hard to differentiate, generate distinct ones by distinguishing between conceptual knowledge (e.g., ontological modeling) and applied techniques (e.g., knowledge graph construction).
4. The language is *[CONCISE & PRECISE / CREATIVE & DETAILED]*, ensuring clarity in an ontology-driven context.
5. The final answer is structured as *[BULLET POINTS / A DETAILED PARAGRAPH]*.
```

3. Ensure the goal description aligns with my domain expertise and the role of ontologies in solving real-world problems.
4. The focus remains solely on ontology-related objectives, avoiding unrelated technical or system-level descriptions.
5. The language is *[CONCISE & PRECISE / CREATIVE & DETAILED]*.
6. The final answer is structured as *[BULLET POINTS / A DETAILED PARAGRAPH / TAXONOMY-LIKE HIERARCHY]*.
```

3. Each step includes specific *[ONTOLOGY ENGINEERING METHODS]*, *[KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION TOOLS]*, or *[INFERENCE TECHNIQUES]* and is practical.
4. Where relevant, incorporate *[INTERDISCIPLINARY INSIGHTS]* to describe the role of ontologies in broader knowledge management.
5. Ensure the actions align logically with my expertise and ontology development goals.
6. The language is *[CONCISE & PRECISE / CREATIVE & DETAILED]*.

The key ontology concepts and terms related to my goal are **[KEYWORDS]**.

Please refine my response to ensure:

1. The keywords are clearly defined and ontology-relevant.
2. Each keyword directly supports knowledge structuring and reasoning.
3. Keywords are aligned with *[EXISTING ONTOLOGY VOCABULARIES]* or *[STANDARDS]*.
4. Keywords are expanded with related ontological terms (e.g., subclass relationships, linked data mappings).
5. The language is *[CONCISE & PRECISE / CREATIVE & DETAILED]*.
6. The final answer is structured as *[BULLET POINTS / A DETAILED PARAGRAPH / TAXONOMY-LIKE HIERARCHY]*.
```

## **Current Methods Refinement**
```plaintext
The current methods I use for knowledge representation and reasoning are **[CURRENT METHODS]**.

Please refine my response to ensure:

1. The methods are clearly described and align with ontology-based workflows.
2. The methods must involve manual or ad-hoc knowledge structuring efforts.
3. The methods are actionable and presented as a logical sequence of ontology modeling or reasoning steps.
4. Each step includes specific *[ONTOLOGY MODELING TOOLS]*, *[KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION LANGUAGES]*, or *[LOGICAL INFERENCE TECHNIQUES]*.
5. Where relevant, incorporate *[INTERDISCIPLINARY INSIGHTS]* to describe the challenges in integrating knowledge across domains.
6. The methods align logically with my expertise and goals.
7. The methods include only knowledge structuring tasks, without discussing challenges, new methods, or expected outcomes.
8. The language is *[CONCISE & PRECISE / CREATIVE & DETAILED]*.
9. The final answer is structured as *[BULLET POINTS / A DETAILED PARAGRAPH / TAXONOMY-LIKE HIERARCHY]*.
```

## **Challenges Refinement**
```plaintext
The challenges I face in ontology-based knowledge representation are **[CHALLENGES]**.

Please refine my response to ensure:

1. The challenges are clearly described and relate to ontology structuring, reasoning, or interoperability.
