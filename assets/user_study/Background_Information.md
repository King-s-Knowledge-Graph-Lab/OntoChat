# Background Information for Ontology User Story Elicitation

## **1. Understanding Domain Ontologies**
A **domain ontology** is a structured representation of knowledge within a specific subject area, such as music, healthcare, or cultural heritage. It defines key concepts, their meanings, and how they relate to each other. This structured approach enables clear communication, knowledge sharing, and interoperability between different systems.

## **2. What is Ontology Construction?**
Ontology construction is the process of creating an organized, machine-readable framework that structures domain-specific knowledge. This involves:
- Defining core concepts and their relationships.
- Establishing a common vocabulary.
- Ensuring logical consistency to facilitate automated reasoning.

Ontology construction serves as the backbone for knowledge-based applications, enabling seamless integration and enhanced searchability of domain information.

## **3. AI Chatbots in Ontology User Story Collection**
An **AI chatbot** is a conversational tool designed to facilitate interviews by asking structured questions, collecting responses, and guiding the discussion dynamically. Leveraging **Generative AI (GenAI)**, it interprets user input, refines queries, and adapts based on responses, creating an intuitive and interactive user experience.

## **4. Understanding Ontology User Stories**
In large-scale ontology development projects, gathering knowledge from domain experts is essential. Traditionally, this requires extensive interviews with multiple experts. 

### **Why Use Ontology User Stories?**
- **User-friendly approach**: Experts articulate their needs through narratives rather than rigid data models.
- **Goal-driven design**: User stories clarify the intended use cases of an ontology, ensuring it aligns with real-world needs.
- **Scope control**: Helps researchers maintain focus, avoiding unnecessary complexity in ontology design.

## **5. Example Ontology User Story: Linka, a Computer Scientist**

### **5.1 Persona**
- **Name**: Linka  
- **Age**: 34  
- **Occupation**: Researcher in Computer Science  
- **Skills**: Expert in Network Data Analysis and Semantic Web technologies, specializing in music knowledge graphs  
- **Interests**: Exploring multi-modal music data, uncovering hidden relationships between artists, composers, and musical pieces  

### **5.2 Goal**
**Description**: Linka aims to efficiently retrieve, integrate, and analyze music-related data from diverse sources to enable large-scale knowledge discovery experiments. Her objectives include:
- Linking, structuring, and enriching multi-modal music datasets.
- Automating discovery of relationships between musical entities.
- Aligning data with knowledge graphs such as MusicBrainz, Wikidata, and Polifonia.

**Keywords**: music data, knowledge graphs, multi-modal data, automated discovery, large-scale integration  

### **5.3 Scenario**
#### **Before Using the Ontology**
Linka manually searches multiple datasets, services, and repositories to collect and integrate music-related data. This process is:
- **Time-consuming**: Extensive manual curation is required.
- **Unscalable**: The increasing volume of data makes manual integration impractical.
- **Error-prone**: Data inconsistencies, such as variations in artist names (*e.g., "Beethoven" vs. "Ludwig van Beethoven"*), create semantic ambiguities.

#### **During Ontology Use**
By leveraging the **Polifonia ontology**, Linka automates data retrieval, integration, and enrichment. She enters search parameters (artist, composer, album), and the system:
- Retrieves structured data from multiple sources.
- Standardizes entity representation to resolve inconsistencies.
- Links data for comprehensive analysis.

#### **After Using the Ontology**
With **automated reasoning and semantic enrichment**, Linka achieves:
- **Advanced computational analysis**: Uncovering hidden influences between classical and contemporary composers.
- **Improved classification**: Refining genre identification and recommendation models.
- **Enhanced interoperability**: Transforming fragmented data into a unified knowledge base.

## **6. What is OntoChat?**
**OntoChat** is an AI-powered conversational assistant designed to guide users through the process of ontology user story elicitation. It interacts dynamically by:
- Asking structured elicitation questions.
- Refining user responses iteratively.
- Ensuring generated user stories align with ontology development goals.

## **7. Purpose of This Study**
The objective of this study is to evaluate how effectively **OntoChat** supports users at different stages of ontology user story creation. Key areas of investigation include:
- The usability, utility, and effectiveness of OntoChat's elicitation process.
