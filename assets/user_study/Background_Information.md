# Background Information You Need to Know

## What is a Domain Ontology?
A domain ontology is like a map of knowledge and how they connect in a specific subject, such as food, music, or health. It explains the important words, their meanings, and how they relate to each other, helping everyone understand and share information clearly.

## What is Ontology Construction?
Ontology construction is the process of creating a structured map of knowledge about a specific topic or domain, like music, healthcare, or food. It involves defining important terms, their meanings, and how they relate to each other, making it easier for people and computers to understand and share information. Think of it as building a detailed guide that organizes complex ideas into a clear and connected framework.

## What is an AI Chatbot?
An AI chatbot for collecting user responses during interviews is a tool designed to ask questions, gather answers, and guide the conversation in a natural way. It uses GenAI to understand your responses and can adjust its questions based on what you say. This makes it an efficient and user-friendly way to collect information while ensuring the interaction feels smooth, just like talking to a person.

## How Can I Understand What is an Ontology User Story?
In real-world ontology construction projects, interviewing hundreds of domain experts is often necessary to gather their knowledge for building an ontology.

- **Ontology user stories** provide a user-friendly approach by asking experts to write stories about their goals and scenarios.
- A **user story** effectively conveys the expert's goals for using the ontology and the scenarios in which it will be applied. It serves as a reflection of their needs.
- By leveraging user stories, researchers can design ontologies that precisely align with the experts' requirements, avoiding scope creep.

## A Good Example of an Ontology User Story

### Persona
- **Name**: Linka
- **Age**: 34
- **Occupation**: Computer Science Researcher
- **Skills**: Expert in Network Data Analysis and Semantic Web technologies, specializing in the music domain.
- **Interests**: Exploring music knowledge graphs to uncover hidden connections between artists, composers, and pieces.

### Goal
- **Goal Description**: Linka seeks to integrate and analyze diverse music-related data for large-scale knowledge discovery.
- **Keywords**: music data, multi-modal data, knowledge discovery.

### Scenario
- **Before**: Linka manually matches music data from multiple sources, a time-consuming process.
- **During**: Using Polifonia, she automates data retrieval by inputting artists, composers, and musical works.
- **After**: The system provides semantically enriched data, enabling large-scale knowledge experiments.
