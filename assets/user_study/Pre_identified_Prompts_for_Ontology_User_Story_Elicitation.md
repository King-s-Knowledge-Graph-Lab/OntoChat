| **Defining roles** | Imagine a character who represents the typical user of this *<ontology>*. This character is called a persona. Describe this persona with details including *<user traits>*, and what they are proficient in or interested in.    |
|                    | Can you add *<user traits>* that are important for this project because *<X>*?                                                                                                                                                   |
|                    | Can you tell me what *<user traits>* are needed when you are assisting in writing an ontology user story? Justify your answer.                                                                                                  |
|                    | Do you think *<user traits>* are necessary for you to help in writing an ontology user story? Justify your answer.                                                                                                               |
| **Defining goals** | Write a concise goal about what this persona aims to achieve using this ontology. This should be brief and to the point. Also, consider a few keywords that summarise their main goals.                                          |
|                    | *<X>* should be considered when defining *<X>* in goals.                                                                                                                                                                         |
|                    | Please refine the goal to be more *<X>*.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Defining scenario** | Narrate a story about how the persona currently performs tasks related to their goal, and how this ontology will make it easier or better for them. This story should include what happens before, during, and after they use this ontology. Keep it brief and relatable. |
|                    | Rephrase this scenario to include *<X>*, because *<X>*.                                                                                                                                                                          |
|                    | *<X>* is not correct. Provide an alternative answer and substantiate that your answer is correct.                                                                                                                                |
|                    | Please consider *<X>* when developing this scenario.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Data resources** | Describe the type of information this ontology will include. Consider what this information looks like, whether it is text, numbers, pictures, or something else. Provide a few examples, such as book titles and authors if your persona is a librarian, or song titles and artists if they are a music enthusiast. Explain how this data is used in your ontology and why it is important for the personaâ€™s goals. |
|                    | Identify potential *<user data resources>* by *<X>*.                                                                                                                                                                             |
|                    | Please check whether *<user data resources>* contains relevant data.                                                                                                                                                            |
