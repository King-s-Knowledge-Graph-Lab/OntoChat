# Instructions on How to Write Ontology User Stories

## Persona
Imagine a character who represents the typical user of your ontology. This character is called a persona. Describe this persona with details such as their name, age, job, and what they are skilled at or interested in. This will help you think about how your ontology can be useful for people like them.

## Goal
Write a brief story about what this persona wants to achieve using your ontology. Keep it concise and focused. Also, consider a few keywords that summarize their main goals, such as "discover music knowledge," "organize cultural data," or "enhance research findings."

## Scenario
Tell a story about how the persona currently handles tasks related to their goal, and how your ontology will make these tasks easier or more effective. This story should cover what happens before, during, and after they use your ontology. Keep it short and relatable.

## Example Data
Describe the type of information the persona will work with in your ontology. Consider what this information looks like—is it text, numbers, images, or something else? Provide a few examples, such as book titles and authors if your persona is a librarian, or song titles and artists if they are a music enthusiast. Explain how this data is utilized in your ontology and why it is important for the persona’s goals.

## Resources (Optional)
If there are websites, books, tools, or other materials that the persona might use or find helpful, list them here. These resources should be easy to understand and relevant to the persona’s interests and goals.
