# Instructions on How to Write Ontology User Stories

Writing ontology user stories is an essential step in ensuring that your ontology aligns with the needs of its users. The following structured approach will guide you through the process of creating well-defined ontology user stories that reflect real-world applications and challenges.

## **1. Define the Persona**
A persona represents the typical user of your ontology. Creating a detailed persona helps contextualize the ontologyâ€™s purpose and ensures that it meets user needs effectively. When defining a persona, consider the following aspects:

- **Name:** Assign a name to the persona to make it more relatable.
- **Age:** Provide an approximate age or age range.
- **Occupation:** Describe the persona's profession or field of expertise.
- **Skills and Interests:** Identify what the persona is proficient in and what they are interested in.

By clearly defining a persona, you can better understand how they would interact with your ontology and what functionality they would expect.

## **2. Establish the Goal**
The goal section should articulate what the persona wants to achieve by using the ontology. This should be concise, clear, and focused on a specific outcome. Consider the following when defining the goal:

- **Primary Objective:** What is the primary reason the persona is using the ontology?
- **Key Benefits:** How will the ontology help the persona achieve their objective?
- **Keywords:** Identify a few keywords that summarize the goal, such as:
  - "Enhance cultural heritage documentation"
  - "Improve semantic search for research publications"
  - "Facilitate interoperability between datasets"

Defining a clear goal ensures that your ontology development aligns with real-world use cases and user needs.

## **3. Describe the Scenario**
A scenario provides a narrative explaining how the persona interacts with the ontology to achieve their goal. A well-defined scenario should include:

- **Current Workflow:** How does the persona currently complete tasks related to their goal without using the ontology? Identify any inefficiencies or challenges.
- **Ontology Intervention:** Describe how the ontology improves the workflow. What specific features or capabilities does it provide?
- **Impact and Outcomes:** Explain the results after the persona integrates the ontology into their process. How does it enhance efficiency, accuracy, or usability?

A strong scenario makes it easier to visualize how the ontology will function in practice and highlights the value it provides.
