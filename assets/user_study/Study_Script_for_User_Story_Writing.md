# Study Script for User Story Writing

## **1. Pre-Interview Preparation**

### **1.1 Materials and Activities Before the Interview**
- Before we begin, please take a moment to reflect on your current process for writing user stories or defining user requirements within software or ontology projects.
- If you have any relevant documentation, templates, or examples, feel free to have them on hand for reference during our discussion.
- If you typically use specific tools for writing user stories, please keep them in mind as we discuss your workflow.

## **2. Opening (Duration: <5 minutes>)**

### **2.1 Introduction and Consent Process**
- Welcome! Thank you for taking the time to participate in this study.
- Before we start, I’d like to introduce myself and provide an overview of what we’ll be doing today.
- I’ll now explain the consent form. Please take a moment to read through it, and let me know if you have any questions before signing.
- I’ll also ask you to complete a short demographics form to collect some background information.

## **3. Discussion on Current Practices in User Story and Requirement Writing (Duration: <10 minutes>)**

### **3.1 Understanding Your Approach**
- Let’s start by discussing your role in writing user stories or defining requirements.
- Can you briefly describe a user story or requirement you have written? What was its purpose, and who was the intended audience?
- What tools or techniques do you use when writing user stories or requirements?
- Walk me through your typical approach when writing a user story from scratch. What are the key considerations for you?
- Can you share an example of a challenge you’ve encountered in user story writing? How did you address it?
- If needed, can you describe a scenario where you had to adapt or develop a new workflow for writing user stories or requirements?

## **4. Participatory Prompting and Turn-Taking (Duration: <30 minutes>)**

### **4.1 Interactive Engagement with LLM-Assisted Writing**
- Now, I will present you with a user story writing prompt or a tool-generated suggestion.
- As you review it, please consider:
  - Did you find this useful? Why or why not?
  - Did anything in the response confuse, surprise, or inspire you?
- Let’s refine your user story or requirement together:
  - What would you like to know next? What additional information would make this more useful?
  - Would you rephrase your query to improve the result? How would you modify it?
- If necessary, I may guide you through an alternative approach:
  - Let’s test an alternative method by modifying the prompt this way (X). What do you think?
  - I propose continuing with (X). Would you have preferred a different approach?
- If the result isn’t what you expected:
  - I see an issue with (X). If we modify the prompt, we might retrieve the data you need. Would you like to proceed?
- If you’re unsure how to proceed, try thinking beyond traditional search-based methods:
  - Imagine you’re discussing this problem with a colleague. How would you refine your request to get clearer insights?

## **5. Post-Activity Interview (Duration: <15 minutes>)**

### **5.1 Evaluating Your Experience and Potential Integration**
- Now, let’s reflect on your experience using this tool.
- How do you see a tool like this fitting into your current workflow?
- If you mentioned that a specific capability (*e.g., If it could do X, it would be helpful*), let’s explore that now and get your thoughts.
- How does this LLM-assisted workflow compare to your usual method of writing user stories or requirements?
- When you found a generated response surprising or inspiring, what additional features or capabilities would help you explore that inspiration further?
- What features do you think would make these inspiring moments more frequent or effective (e.g., suggested prompts, structured refinements)?
- How do you think your overall approach to writing user stories or requirements would change with a tool like this?
- Were there any barriers or frustrations that prevented you from fully exploring your query?
- What do you think are the advantages and disadvantages of using a conversational, chat-based interface for writing user stories or requirements?

## **6. Concluding Remarks**
