# Study Script for User Story Writing

## **1. Pre-Interview Preparation**

### **1.1 Materials and Activities Before the Interview**
- Participants should reflect on their current processes for writing user stories or defining user requirements within software or ontology projects.
- Participants should gather any relevant documentation, templates, or examples they may need during the interview.
- Ensure participants have access to any tools or resources they typically use for user story writing.

## **2. Opening (Duration: <5 minutes>)**

### **2.1 Introduction and Consent Process**
- Begin with introductions and casual conversation to establish a comfortable environment.
- Provide participants with an overview of the study, including its purpose and structure.
- Explain the consent form, ensure the participant understands their rights, and obtain their signed consent.
- Ask participants to fill out a demographics form to collect relevant background information.

## **3. Discussion on Current Practices in User Story and Requirement Writing (Duration: <10 minutes>)**

### **3.1 Understanding Participants' Approaches**
- Request participants to briefly describe their role in writing user stories or defining requirements.
- Ask participants to describe a user story or requirement they have written, highlighting its intended purpose and audience.
- Discuss the tools and techniques participants use in their user story or requirement writing process.
- Explore how participants typically approach writing a user story from scratch, including key considerations and challenges.
- Encourage participants to share a hypothetical or real challenge they have encountered in user story writing and how they approached resolving it.
- If necessary, prompt participants to provide an example of a situation that required them to adapt or develop a new workflow for writing user stories or requirements.

## **4. Participatory Prompting and Turn-Taking (Duration: <30 minutes>)**

### **4.1 Interactive Engagement with LLM-Assisted Writing**
- Present a user story writing prompt or tool-generated suggestion and ask:
  - *Did you find this useful? Why or why not?*
  - *Did anything in the response confuse, surprise, or inspire you?*
- Guide participants through iterative refinement of their user story or requirement:
  - *What would you like to know next? What additional information would make this more useful?*
  - *Would you rephrase your query to improve the result? How would you modify it?*
- Experimenter-driven engagement (at most once in a row):
  - *Let's test an alternative approach by modifying the prompt in this way (X). What do you think?*
  - *I propose continuing with (X). Would you have preferred a different approach?*
- If a result is unsatisfactory:
  - *I notice an issue with (X). If we modify the prompt, we might retrieve the data you need. Would you like to proceed?*
- If a participant is stuck, encourage them to think beyond traditional search-based methods:
  - *Imagine you are discussing this problem with a colleague. How would you refine your request to get clearer insights?*

## **5. Post-Activity Interview (Duration: <15 minutes>)**

### **5.1 Evaluating the Experience and Potential Integration**
- *How would a tool like this integrate into your existing workflow?*
- If a participant suggests a useful capability (*e.g., If it could do X, it would be helpful*), attempt to demonstrate it and gather feedback while managing time constraints.
- *What benefits does this LLM-assisted workflow provide compared to your current method of writing user stories or requirements?*
- *When you found a generated response surprising or inspiring, what additional features or capabilities would help you explore that inspiration further?*
- *What features do you think would improve the effectiveness and frequency of these inspiring moments (e.g., suggested prompts, structured refinements)?*
- *How do you think your overall approach to writing user stories or requirements would change with a tool like this?*
- *What barriers or frustrations did you experience that prevented you from fully exploring your query?*
- *What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a conversational, chat-based interface for user story or requirement writing?*

## **6. Concluding Remarks**

### **6.1 Wrapping Up the Session**
- Thank the participant for their time and valuable insights.
- Reiterate the purpose of the study and how their feedback contributes to improvements.
- Address any final questions or comments from the participant.
- Inform the participant about any follow-up communication, if applicable.
- End the session on a positive and appreciative note.
