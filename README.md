# OntoChat: Leveraging Large Language Models and Human-Centered Design for Ontology User Story Generation  

**OntoChat** is a conversational agent powered by LLMs, designed to facilitate **collaborative ontology engineering**, with a focus on **ontology requirements elicitation**. It guides user prompting at each interaction stage by providing **elicitation questions, example answers, and prompt templates**, helping users generate **relevant and useful requirements** for ontology development. OntoChat is publicly available on **[Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/1hangzhao/OntoChat)**. For the best experience, we recommend using **Google Chrome**.
